## 1. Problem Statement (Original Statement):
Migration of C/C++ Cryptographic Algorithms to Rust, Demonstrating Memory Safety
POPL Angle:
The Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) angle in our project lies in the exploration of memory safety aspects when migrating cryptographic algorithms from C/C++ to Rust. POPL focuses on the design and analysis of programming languages, and in this context, our project aims to demonstrate how Rust, with its emphasis on memory safety, can provide a more secure alternative to traditional languages like C/C++ for implementing cryptographic algorithms.
Previous Solutions:
Cryptographic algorithms have been implemented in various programming languages, including C/C++ for their efficiency. However, these languages are notorious for memory-related vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and data corruption.
Differences in Our Solution:
Our solution involves migrating the RC4 and RSA cryptographic algorithms from C/C++ to Rust, a language known for its focus on memory safety. By doing so, we aim to address and mitigate common vulnerabilities associated with C/C++ implementations. This migration allows for a comparative analysis of the memory safety aspects between the two languages. It's not just about implementing the algorithms; it's about leveraging Rust's features to enhance the security of cryptographic code.

## 1. POPL Aspects in RC4 Implementation:

### Memory Safety with Indexing:

In the ksa and pgra functions, array indexing is used (s[i] and key[i % key_len]) to access elements safely within bounds.
Avoiding Buffer Overflows:

The use of safe indexing and swapping in the state vector (s.swap(i, j)) helps prevent buffer overflows and ensures memory safety.
Static Typing in Rust:

Types are explicitly declared (s: &mut [u8; 256], key: [u8; 9]), utilizing Rust's static typing for compile-time type checking.
Lifetime Annotations:

Lifetime annotations are not explicitly used in these snippets, but the borrow checker ensures proper referencing and borrowing, contributing to memory safety.
POPL Aspects in RSA Implementation:

### Memory Safety with Vec<u8>:

The use of Vec<u8> for data storage ensures dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, contributing to memory safety.
Error Handling with Result Type:

The expect method is used for error handling after encrypting and decrypting data, ensuring that any errors during these operations are handled explicitly.
Static Typing and Explicit Type Conversion:

Types are explicitly declared (bits: usize, string: String), and there's explicit type conversion (string.as_bytes()) to ensure type safety.
Use of External Libraries (rsa, rand, hex):

External libraries like rsa, rand, and hex are utilized, and their use aligns with memory safety principles as they are expected to be implemented with those considerations.
Difficulties and Experiences:

### Transition from C to Rust:

Moving from the C-style manual memory management to Rust's ownership model might pose challenges. Ensuring lifetimes and borrowing are appropriately managed could be an initial difficulty.
Understanding External Libraries:

Incorporating and understanding external libraries, such as rsa and hex, might require familiarity with their documentation and potentially adjusting code to match their conventions.
Error Handling Paradigm Shift:

Shifting from C-style error handling to Rust's Result type might be challenging initially. Ensuring comprehensive error checking is crucial for robust code.
Ensuring Memory Safety in Cryptographic Operations:

Given the sensitivity of cryptographic operations, thorough testing and validation are essential to ensure memory safety, avoiding potential vulnerabilities.
